# Quantum Decoherence can Obstruct the Measurement Accuracy of Quantum Circuit Algorithms
Mini presentation project created in August 2020 that explores the basic quantum gates (Hadamard, Inverter, Toffoli) and quantum simulators in IBM programming language Qiskit while discussing the major issue that hinders quantum computation today.
